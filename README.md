### Hi there 👋

I'm a C++, Java and Kotlin dev.  Mostly Linux and C++ these days, but a lot Win32 in the past, and even some MacOS.

I've also written non-trivial amounts of C#, Javascript and some Typescript.

And some Swift, D, Rust, golang, and even some F# back in the day.


And that heatmap thing down there ⬇️⬇️⬇️ ?  Well, not everything gets published to github...
